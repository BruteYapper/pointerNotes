# Const and Pointers

- There are several ways to qualify pointers using const
    - Pointers to constants
    - Constant pointers
    - Constant pointers to constants


## Pointers to Constants

- The data pointed to by the pointers is constant and **cannot** be changed.
- The pointer itself can change and point somewhere else.

```cpp
int highScore {100};
int lowScore {65};

const int *scorePtr {&highScore};

*scorePtr = 50; // ERROR
scorePtr = &lowScore; // OK
```


## Constant Pointers

- The data pointed to by the pointers can be changed.
- The pointer itself cannot change and point somewhere else

```cpp 
int highScore {100};
int lowScore {65};

int *const scorePtr {&highScore};

*scorePtr = 86; // OK
scorePtr = &lowScore; // ERROR
```

## Constant Pointers to Constants
- The data pointed to by the pointer is constant and cannot be changed.
- The pointer itself cannot change and point somewhere else

```cpp 
int highScore {100};
int lowScore {65};

const int *const scorePtr {&highScore};

*scorePtr = 86; // ERROR
scorePtr = &lowScore; // ERROR
```
