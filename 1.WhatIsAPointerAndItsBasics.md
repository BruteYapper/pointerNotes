# What is a Pointer
## * A variable
- whose value is an address

## * What can be at that address?
- Another variable
- A function

## * Pointers point to variables or functions (and arrays)

# Why use Pointers?

Can't I just use the variable or function itself?

**yes but not allways** 

* inside functions, pointers can be used to access data that are defined outside teh function. Those variables may not be in scope so you can't access them by their name (so you can access the data directly, instead of copping it)

<br/>

* Pointers can be used to operate on arrays very efficiently

<br/>

* We can allocate memory dynamically on the heap or free store.
    - This memory doesn't even have a variable name.
    - The only way to get to it is via a pointer

<br/>

* With OO. pointers are how polymorphism works!

<br/>

* Can access specific addresses in memory
    - useful in embedded and system applications






# Exampes

Declaring a pointer
```
variableType *pointerName;
```

EX
```cpp
int *intPtr;
double* doublePtr;
char *charPtr;
string *stringPtr;
```
all styles are equivalent

**it is very important that you initialize your pointers before you use them because they will have garbage data if you don't**


```cpp
int *intPtr {};
double* doublePtr {nullptr};
char *charPtr {nullptr};
string *stringPtr {nullptr};
```
these all work


# Storing an Address in pointer variable

**&** the address operator

```cpp
double highTemp {100.7};
double lowTemp {37.7};

double *tempPtr;

tempPtr = &highTemp; // points to high temp
tempPtr = &lowTemp; // points to low temp

tempPtr = nullptr;
```


one more example 
```cpp

int num{10};
std::cout << "Value of Num is: " << num << std::endl; // print the value of the pointer (the address it points to)

std::cout << "Value of Num is: " << sizeof num << std::endl; // the memory in bytes allocated to store that address

std::cout << "Value of Num is: " << &num << std::endl; // the address where the pointer itself is in memory

```
