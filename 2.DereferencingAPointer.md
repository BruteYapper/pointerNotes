# Dereferencing a Pointer

```cpp
int score {100};
int *scorePtr {&score};

std::cout << *scorePtr << std::endl; // 100

*scorePtr = 200; // the * follows the pointer and gets us what it points to

std::cout << *scorePtr << std::endl; // 200
std::cout << score << std::endl; // 200
// the first var changed because that is what the pointer was pointing at

```


int *test {nullptr};

test // the address test is pointing to / the address the value is located

*test // the value

&test // the address of the pointer itself
