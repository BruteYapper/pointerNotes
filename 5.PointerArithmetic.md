# Pointer Arithmetic

- (++) increments a pointer to point to the next array element
```cpp
intPtr++;
```

- (--) decrements a pointer to point to the next previous array element
```cpp
intPtr--;
```

- (+) increments pointer by n * sizeof(type) (increment the pointer to the element that is n spaces away)
```cpp
intPtr += n; or intPtr intPtr + n;
```

- (-) decrements pointer by n * sizeof(type) (decrement the pointer to the element that is n spaces away)
```cpp
intPtr -= n; or intPtr = intPtr - n;
```


## Subtracting two pointers

- Determine the number of elements bewteen the pointers
- Both pointers must point to the same data type (if they don't you will get a compiler error)
```cpp
int n = intPtr2 - intPtr1;
```


## Comparing two pointers == and !=

Determine if two pointers point to the same location
- does NOT compare the data where they point!

```cpp
string s1 {"Frank"};
string s2 {"Frank"};

string *p1 {&s1};
string *p2 {&s2};
string *p3 {&s1};

cout << (p1 == p2) << endl; // false
cout << (p1 == p3) << endl; // true
```


## Comparing the data two pointers point to

Determine if two pointers point to the data location
- you must compare the referenced pointers

```cpp
string s1 {"Frank"};
string s2 {"Frank"};

string *p1 {&s1};
string *p2 {&s2};
string *p3 {&s1};

cout << (*p1 == *p2) << endl; // true
cout << (*p1 == *p3) << endl; // true
```

## Dereferencing a pointer and incramenting

```cpp
int main(){
    int scores[] {100, 95, 89, 68, -1};
    int *scorePtr {scores}; // arrays point to the first element in the list

    while(*scorePtr != -1){
        cout << *scorePtr << endl;
        scorePtr++;
    }

    cout << "\n-------------------------" << endl;
    scorePtr = scores;

    while(*scorePtr != -1){ // this while loop does the same as above
        cout << *scorePtr++ << endl; // this is because the the postfix increment runs first(before the pointer is dereferenced) and only adds to the address after the line is run
        // this is because of the C++ Operator Precedence (see link below)
    }
}
```
