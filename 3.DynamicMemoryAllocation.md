# Dynamic Memory Allocation


```cpp
int *intPtr {nullptr};

intPtr = new int; // allocate and integer on the heap

cout << intPtr << endl; // address pointer is pointing to

cout << *intPtr << endl; // garbage data

*intPtr = 100;

cout << *intPtr << endl; // 100

delete intPtr; // frees the allocated storage // make sure the address of intPtr is an address gained by using the "new" keyword 
```

using new[] to allocate storage for an array


```cpp
int *arrayPtr {nullptr};
int size {};

cout << "How big do you want the array? ";
cin >> size;

arrayPtr = new int[size]; // allocate array on the heap // this is will attempt to allocate the "size" number of int elements contiguously in memory // the array pointer will point to the first element in the array
// we can access the array here 

...

delete [] arrayPtr // free allocated storate
```
